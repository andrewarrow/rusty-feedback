This is the web framework you use when it's your choice. This is a
web framework that makes it fun and easy to throw together anything
web related.

It's an opinionated framework.

We use full page refreshes by default. When frontend work is required we do that on a per page basis. It's nice to have normal users that render super fast HTML pages.
